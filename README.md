# Expo CLI `expo prebuild` Ambiguous Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, ambiguous error encountered when using the `expo prebuild` command in the Expo CLI. The error message often lacks sufficient detail to pinpoint the problem's origin, making debugging challenging.

## Problem

The `expo prebuild` command fails without providing specific information about the underlying cause. The error message may be vague, such as a generic error or a stack trace that's difficult to interpret in the context of the Expo build process.

## Solution

The solution involves a systematic approach to identify the cause. This could include:

* **Checking `package.json`:** Ensure all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible with the Expo SDK version.
* **Verifying Native Modules:** Confirm that any native modules required are correctly linked and configured. 
* **Inspecting `expo.json`:** Verify that the configurations within `expo.json` (or `app.json`) are accurate and consistent.
* **Cleaning the Project:** Sometimes, cached files or old builds interfere. Try running `expo clean` before `expo prebuild`.
* **Checking for Incompatibilities:** Review any recent changes in the project or updated dependencies for potential conflicts.
* **Updating Expo CLI:** Update your Expo CLI to the latest version.

This repository provides sample code to illustrate the error and a possible solution path.
