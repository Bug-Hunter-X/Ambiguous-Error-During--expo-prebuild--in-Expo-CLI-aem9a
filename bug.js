This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, which prepares your project for a build process.  It might manifest when certain dependencies aren't correctly configured or are incompatible with the chosen build system (EAS Build or similar). The underlying issue could stem from problems with your project's `package.json`, missing native modules, or incorrect configuration within the `app.json` or `expo.json` files.  It might also be related to issues with the Expo Go app if you're developing on that platform and not building a standalone app.
